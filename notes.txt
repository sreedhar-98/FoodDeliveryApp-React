Parcel uses babel to convert jsx to react.


React Component:
    1. Class Based Component  --> OLD WAY(Not Used now).
    2. Functional Component   --> Latest  --> It is a normal js function which returns JSX.

Component Composition --> A Component embedded inside another Component.

JSX prevents cross-site injection attacks.
